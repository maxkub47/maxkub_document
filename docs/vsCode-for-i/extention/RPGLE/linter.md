The information below is specific to the linter in the RPGLE extension.

## Opening the linter config

Use `vscode-rpgle.openLintConfig` to open the rules configuration for the source you're working in.

![Open Lint Configuration command](../../img/rpgle/OpenLintConfig.png)

Or you can right click on a library filter:

![Open Lint Config with a click](../../img/rpgle/OpenLintConfig_02.png)

If a linter rules file does not exist, you will be asked asked if you want to create one. The created file will provide some default rules, as below.

## Relative lint config

* If you are developing in source members (`LIB/QRPGLESRC/MYSOURCE.RPGLE`)
   * the the linter config exists in `LIB/VSCODE/RPGLINT.JSON`. 
   * Each library has its own rules configuration file, binding it to all RPGLE sources in that library. 
   * config changes get pickup when RPGLE sources are re-opened.
* When developing in the IFS:
   * linter rules config exist in `.vscode/rpglint.json` relative to the current working directory.
   * config changes get pickup when RPGLE sources are re-opened.
* When developing in a local workspace
   * linter rules exist in `.vscode/rpglint.json` relative to the workspace.
   * Local RPGLE gets scanned automatically when config is changed

## Lint options

Below are some available lint configs. [See the `rpglint.json` schema for the most up to date rules](https://github.com/codefori/vscode-rpgle/blob/main/schemas/rpglint.json).

|---|---|
| ðŸŒŸ | Clean code |

| ðŸ”’ | Secure code |

### `SpecificCasing` example

This rule allows you to specify the casing required for any or all declares or BIFs.

If you want all `DCL` to be lower case and all `BIF`s to be upper case, then it would be coded like this:

```json
   "SpecificCasing":[
      {"operation": "*BIF","expected": "*upper"},
      {"operation": "*DECLARE", "expected": "*lower"}
   ]
```

If you wanted `%parms` and `%timestamp` to always be lower case, and all other BIFs to be upper case, then it would be coded like this:

```json
   "SpecificCasing": [
      {
         "operation": "%parms",
         "expected": "*lower"
      },
      {
         "operation": "%timestamp",
         "expected": "*lower"
      },
      {
         "operation": "*bif",
         "expected": "*upper"
      }
   ]
```

:::danger
   The order of entries above is important.
:::

Or, if for some reason, you wanted `%timestamp` to always be coded as `%TimeStamp` then it could be coded like this:

```json
   "SpecificCasing": [
      {
         "operation": "%parms",
         "expected": "*lower"
      },
      {
         "operation": "%timestamp",
         "expected": "*TimeStamp"
      },
      {
         "operation": "*bif",
         "expected": "*upper"
      }
   ]
```
